    Distance between two 3rd order (rank 3) tensors under the specified type of norm.
    The tensors `x` and `y` should be flattened into 1D numpy arrays before calling this function.
    If `xt` and `yt` are the tensors, each of shape `shape`, they can be flattened into a 1D array using
    `x = xt.reshape(-1)` (and likewise for `yt`). The shape is passed as input, which is used by the function
    to reshape the arrays to tensors.

    The inputs are taken as 1d arrays in order to be consistent  with the function signature required by
    another library.

    The input `norm_type` is a tuple of length three that takes the norm parameters `p, q, r`, which together specify
    the type of norm used. They should be integers >= 1.
    For example, the default value `norm_type=(2, 2, 2)` computes the `l2` or Euclidean norm of the flattened tensor.
    The value `norm_type=(1, 1, 1)` computes the `l1` norm of the flattened tensor.

    The special case `p = -1` with finite `q` and `r` calculates the norm with `p = \infty`. The value `-1` is
    used instead of `np.infty` because numba does not handle tuple with mixed float and int values.

def distance_SNN(x, y):
    """
    Shared nearest neighbor distance metric. This is a secondary (ranking-based) distance measure.
    First, a standard distance metric is used to find the K nearest neighbors (K-NN) of each point from a fixed set
    of `N` points. If `N` and/or the dimensionality is large, this can be done by constructing an approximate
    nearest neighbor index and querying it.

    The shared nearest neighbor (SNN) similarity between two points `x` and `y` is defined as the size of the
    intersection of their K-NN sets, divided by `K`. This is equal to the cosine similarity between the binary
    representation of the two points (of length `N`) in which the presence of as neighbor is indicated by 1
    and absence by 0. This is easy to see because their inner product will be the number of overlapping neighbors,
    and the norm of each vector will be `sqrt(K)`.

    The cosine similarity is translated into a distance by taking the inverse-cosine which gives and angle
    value between `[0, \pi]`.
